# Clickstream Prediction

IN PROGRESS:  The [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset) has been used in previous research for training models on clickstream data. The data as is contains no missing values, requiring some EDA and cleaning to run with various models. This dataset is often used for comparing featrue selection and classification model comparison. It also includes opportunities to explore both direct and indirect measures of behavior with respect to their predictive value. Along with comparing feature selection and model perfomance, I am hoping to evaluate if behavioral components might be valuably included in this process. So far, I am experimenting with different ways to prepare the data, and considering relevant features for model comparison. Currently, I am hand-picking predictors based on feature importance from 2 feature selection methods (random forests, mutual information). This approach seems to be resulting in better performing models than with PCA.

# Clickstream Prediction

IN PROGRESS:  The [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset) has been used in previous research for training models on clickstream data. The data as is contains no missing values, requiring some EDA and cleaning to run with various models. The analysis uses feature selection with some manual discretizing for mutual information. Smote is used to handle class imbalaces. This really is just an opportunity to explore with different feature selection approaches (i.e. mutual information and x2), while comparing different model approaches (i.e. XGboost, random forest) with clickstream data.
